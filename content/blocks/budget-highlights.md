## Changes to Note in the 2024-25 Proposed Budget
1. Adjusts our offering goal to match actual giving in 2023-24 ($1.3M).
2. Asks our Pastoral Staff to forego certain compensation benefits and most
ministries to reduce spending and/or postpone plans.
3. Affirms our commitment to church planting and beginning the next phase of
Arch Ministries.
4. Funding for a future building has been moved from the budget to the Blessing Plan.

### Why do we need to adjust our offering levels and ask ministries to reduce spending?
During COVID, our offerings went up significantly. They have now returned to a normal growth rate.
This, along with a temporary increase of support to Arch Ministries, is the reason why we need
to make adjustments this year.
