## Highlights of the 2024-2025 Proposed Budget
1. Reduced our offering goal down to match offerings from 2023-24 actual giving.
2. Asks our Pastoral Staff to forego certain benefits and most ministries to reduce spending
and/or postpone plans.
3. Affirms our commitment to church planting and beginning the next phase of Arch
Ministries.

### Why do we need to adjust our offering levels and ask pastors and ministries to sacrifice?
During COVID our offerings went up significantly. They have now returned to a normal growth rate.
This, along with some temporary increase of support to Arch Ministries, is the reason why we need
to make adjustments this year.
